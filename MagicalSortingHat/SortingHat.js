// The Magical Sorting Hat: Imagine you are creating  a magical sorting hat for a wizard school. Implement a JavaScript function that takes an array of student names and assigns them to one of the four houses 
// (Gryffindor (length less than 6)), 
// (Hufflepuff(length less than 8)) , 
// (RavenClaw(length less than 12)), 
// (Slytherin(Length greater than or equal to 12)) 
// based on the length of their names.
